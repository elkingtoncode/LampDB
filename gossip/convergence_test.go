// NOTE: This test is non-deterministic because it involves multiple goroutines
// that may not all be able to keep up if the given interval is too small.
// As a rule of thumb, increase the interval until the same number of cycles are used
// for both race and non-race tests; this indicates that no goroutines are being
// left behind by CPU limits.
// TODO(spencer): figure out a more deterministic setup, advancing the clock
// manually and counting cycles accurately instead of relying on real-time sleeps.
